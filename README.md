# Syte in PHP

Please read about it here: [http://github.com/rigoneri/syte](http://github.com/rigoneri/syte)

I wanted to use Syte but didn't want to use Django.
So I rewrote it in PHP using [KISSMVC](http://kissmvc.com/).

This isn't a full conversion, there is stuff missing. I used the django version locally to get my oauth tokens and secrets.
